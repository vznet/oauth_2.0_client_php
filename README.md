OAuth 2.0 client library PHP
============================

This PHP library helps you to implement an OAuth 2.0 client.

It uses the draft 10 of the current OAuth 2.0 specification [1]

Currently only the web_server flow and the core response_type is supported.

**THIS LIBRARY WILL NOT BE DEVELOPED ANY FURTHER**

If you want to fork, go ahead. No pull-requests will be merged though.
